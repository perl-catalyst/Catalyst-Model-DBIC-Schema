NAME
    Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema - DBIx::Class::Schema Model Class

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp::Model::Foo;
        use strict;
        use base 'Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema';

        __PACKAGE__->config(
            schema_class => 'Foo::SchemaClass',
            connect_info => [ 'dbi:Pg:dbname=foodb',
                              'postgres',
                              '',
                              { AutoCommit => 1 },
                            ],
        );

        1;

        # In controller code:

        # ->schema To access schema methods:
        $c->model('Foo')->schema->source(...);

        # certain ->schema methods (source, resultset, class) have shortcuts
        $c->model('Foo')->source(...);
        $c->model('Foo')->resultset(...);
        $c->model('Foo')->class(...);

        # For resultsets, there's an even quicker shortcut:
        $c->model('Foo::Bar')
        # is the same as $c->model('Foo')->resultset('Bar')

        # To get the composed schema for making new connections:
        my $newconn = $c->model('Foo')->composed_schema->connect(...);

        # Or the same thing via a convenience shortcut:
        my $newconn = $c->model('Foo')->connect(...);

        # or, if your schema works on different storage drivers:
        my $newconn = $c->model('Foo')->composed_schema->clone();
        $newconn->storage_type('::LDAP');
        $newconn->connection(...);

        # and again, a convenience shortcut
        my $newconn = $c->model('Foo')->clone();
        $newconn->storage_type('::LDAP');
        $newconn->connection(...);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Catalyst Model for DBIx::Class::Schema-based Models. See the
    documentation for Catalyst::Helper::Model::DBIC::Schema and
    Catalyst::Helper::Model::DBIC::SchemaInlineLoader for information on
    generating these Models via Helper scripts.

CONFIG PARAMETERS
    schema_class
        This is the classname of your DBIx::Class::Schema Schema. It needs
        to be findable in @INC, but it does not need to be underneath
        "Catalyst::Model::". This parameter is required.

    connect_info
        This is an arrayref of connection parameters, which are specific to
        your "storage_type". For "::DBI", which is the only supported
        "storage_type" in DBIx::Class at the time of this writing, the 4
        parameters are your dsn, username, password, and connect options
        hashref.

        This is not required if "schema_class" already has connection
        information defined in itself (which would be the case for a Schema
        defined by DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader, for instance).

    storage_type
        Allows the use of a different "storage_type" than what is set in
        your "schema_class" (which in turn defaults to "::DBI" if not set in
        current DBIx::Class). Completely optional, and probably unneccesary
        for most people, until other storage backends become available for
        DBIx::Class.

METHODS
    new Instantiates the Model based on the above-documented ->config
        parameters. The only required parameter is "schema_class".
        "connect_info" is required in the case that "schema_class" does not
        already have connection information defined for it.

    schema
        Accessor which returns the connected schema being used by the this
        model. There are already direct shortcuts on the model class itself
        for schema->resultset, schema->source, and schema->class.

    composed_schema
        Accessor which returns the composed schema, which has no connection
        info, which was used in constructing the "schema" above. Useful for
        creating new connections based on the same schema/model. There are
        direct shortcuts from the model object for composed_schema->clone
        and composed_schema->connect

    clone
        Shortcut for ->composed_schema->clone

    connect
        Shortcut for ->composed_schema->connect

    source
        Shortcut for ->schema->source

    class
        Shortcut for ->schema->class

    resultset
        Shortcut for ->schema->resultset
