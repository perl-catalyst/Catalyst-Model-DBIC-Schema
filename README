NAME
    Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema - DBIx::Class::Schema Model Class

SYNOPSIS
    Manual creation of a DBIx::Class::Schema and a
    Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema:

    1.  Create the DBIx:Class schema in MyApp/Schema/FilmDB.pm:

          package MyApp::Schema::FilmDB;
          use base qw/DBIx::Class::Schema/;

          __PACKAGE__->load_classes(qw/Actor Role/);

    2.  Create some classes for the tables in the database, for example an
        Actor in MyApp/Schema/FilmDB/Actor.pm:

          package MyApp::Schema::FilmDB::Actor;
          use base qw/DBIx::Class/

          __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/Core/);
          __PACKAGE__->table('actor');

          ...

        and a Role in MyApp/Schema/Role.pm:

          package MyApp::Schema::FilmDB::Role;
          use base qw/DBIx::Class/

          __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/Core/);
          __PACKAGE__->table('role');

          ...    

        Notice that the schema is in MyApp::Schema, not in MyApp::Model.
        This way it's usable as a standalone module and you can test/run it
        without Catalyst.

    3.  To expose it to Catalyst as a model, you should create a DBIC Model
        in MyApp/Model/FilmDB.pm:

          package MyApp::Model::FilmDB;
          use base qw/Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema/;

          __PACKAGE__->config(
              schema_class => 'MyApp::Schema::FilmDB',
              connect_info => [
                                "DBI:...",
                                "username",
                                "password",
                                {AutoCommit => 1}
                              ]
          );

        See below for a full list of the possible config parameters.

    Now you have a working Model, accessing your separate DBIC Schema. Which
    can be used/accessed in the normal Catalyst manner, via $c->model():

      my $actor = $c->model('FilmDB::Actor')->find(1);

    You can also use it to set up DBIC authentication with
    Authentication::Store::DBIC in MyApp.pm:

      package MyApp;

      use Catalyst qw/... Authentication::Store::DBIC/;

      ...

      __PACKAGE__->config->{authentication}{dbic} = {
          user_class      => 'FilmDB::Actor',
          user_field      => 'name',
          password_field  => 'password'
      }

    "$c->model()" returns a DBIx::Class::ResultSet for the source name
    parameter passed. To find out more about which methods can be called on
    a ResultSet, or how to add your own methods to it, please see the
    ResultSet documentation in the DBIx::Class distribution.

    Some examples are given below:

      # to access schema methods directly:
      $c->model('FilmDB')->schema->source(...);

      # to access the source object, resultset, and class:
      $c->model('FilmDB')->source(...);
      $c->model('FilmDB')->resultset(...);
      $c->model('FilmDB')->class(...);

      # For resultsets, there's an even quicker shortcut:
      $c->model('FilmDB::Actor')
      # is the same as $c->model('FilmDB')->resultset('Actor')

      # To get the composed schema for making new connections:
      my $newconn = $c->model('FilmDB')->composed_schema->connect(...);

      # Or the same thing via a convenience shortcut:
      my $newconn = $c->model('FilmDB')->connect(...);

      # or, if your schema works on different storage drivers:
      my $newconn = $c->model('FilmDB')->composed_schema->clone();
      $newconn->storage_type('::LDAP');
      $newconn->connection(...);

      # and again, a convenience shortcut
      my $newconn = $c->model('FilmDB')->clone();
      $newconn->storage_type('::LDAP');
      $newconn->connection(...);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Catalyst Model for DBIx::Class::Schema-based Models. See the
    documentation for Catalyst::Helper::Model::DBIC::Schema for information
    on generating these Models via Helper scripts.

CONFIG PARAMETERS
    schema_class
        This is the classname of your DBIx::Class::Schema Schema. It needs
        to be findable in @INC, but it does not need to be inside the
        "Catalyst::Model::" namespace. This parameter is required.

    connect_info
        This is an arrayref of connection parameters, which are specific to
        your "storage_type" (see your storage type documentation for more
        details).

        This is not required if "schema_class" already has connection
        information defined inside itself (which isn't highly recommended,
        but can be done)

        For DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI, which is the only supported
        "storage_type" in DBIx::Class at the time of this writing, the
        parameters are your dsn, username, password, and connect options
        hashref.

        If you need to specify the DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI specific
        parameter "on_connect_do", or the related "sql_maker" options
        "limit_dialect", "quote_char", or "name_sep", you can place these
        options into a hashref as the final element of the "connect_info"
        arrayref. If in doubt, don't specify these options. You would know
        it if you needed them.

        Examples:

          connect_info => [ 'dbi:Pg:dbname=mypgdb', 'postgres', '' ],

          connect_info => [
                            'dbi:SQLite:dbname=foo.db',
                            {
                              on_connect_do => [
                                'PRAGMA synchronous = OFF',
                              ],
                            }
                          ],

          connect_info => [
                            'dbi:Pg:dbname=mypgdb',
                            'postgres',
                            '',
                            { AutoCommit => 0 },
                            {
                              on_connect_do => [
                                'some SQL statement',
                                'another SQL statement',
                              ],
                            }
                          ],

    storage_type
        Allows the use of a different "storage_type" than what is set in
        your "schema_class" (which in turn defaults to "::DBI" if not set in
        current DBIx::Class). Completely optional, and probably unnecessary
        for most people until other storage backends become available for
        DBIx::Class.

METHODS
    new Instantiates the Model based on the above-documented ->config
        parameters. The only required parameter is "schema_class".
        "connect_info" is required in the case that "schema_class" does not
        already have connection information defined for it.

    schema
        Accessor which returns the connected schema being used by the this
        model. There are direct shortcuts on the model class itself for
        schema->resultset, schema->source, and schema->class.

    composed_schema
        Accessor which returns the composed schema, which has no connection
        info, which was used in constructing the "schema" above. Useful for
        creating new connections based on the same schema/model. There are
        direct shortcuts from the model object for composed_schema->clone
        and composed_schema->connect

    clone
        Shortcut for ->composed_schema->clone

    connect
        Shortcut for ->composed_schema->connect

    source
        Shortcut for ->schema->source

    class
        Shortcut for ->schema->class

    resultset
        Shortcut for ->schema->resultset

    storage
        Provides an accessor for the connected schema's storage object. Used
        often for debugging and controlling transactions.
