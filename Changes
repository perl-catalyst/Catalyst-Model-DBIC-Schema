          (should have been done last release)
        - Removed the ->require stuff added in 0.07, it doesn't
          do what it is supposed to do.  For now, users can layer
          at the Schema::Loader level rather than at Model.

0.07  Sun Feb 19 21:50:18 UTC 2006
        - bugfix for ::SchemaLoader::Foo password argument, and
          switch to connect_info argument of new Schema::Loader
