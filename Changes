	- Be more verbose when connection_info is not set.

0.15  Tue Jun  6 01:33:57 UTC 2006
        - Fixed a serious bug in create=static usage
        - Re-arranged output generation so that the more likely
          failure to generate Schemas via create= will cause the
          helper to abort before generating the Model class itself

        - Helpers merged, helper syntax changed
        - Everything updated for Schema::Loader 0.03001 support, including
          what amounts to using Loader in one-shot mode to generate
          a manual Schema with matching Model.
        - fixed stupid typo in docs

0.13  Wed Apr 26 2006
        - noted support via mailing lists

0.12  Tue Apr 25 2006
        - SYNOPSIS improved substantially to help newbies get started

0.11  Sun Mar 26 17:22:31 UTC 2006
        - Removed on_connect_do config setting (it was only out
          in public for 4 days...).
        - Support for on_connect_do and sql_maker options as part
          of connect_info

0.08  Tue Feb 28 00:04:16 UTC 2006
        - Bumped D::C::Schema::Loader recommendation to 0.02003
          (should have been done last release)
        - Removed the ->require stuff added in 0.07, it doesn't
          do what it is supposed to do.  For now, users can layer
          at the Schema::Loader level rather than at Model.

0.07  Sun Feb 19 21:50:18 UTC 2006
        - bugfix for ::SchemaLoader::Foo password argument, and
          switch to connect_info argument of new Schema::Loader
        - Added ->require for source classes, so that you can
          layer in lib/MyApp/Model/Foo/Bar.pm on top of the
          generated MyApp::Model::Foo::Bar.
