        - Updated for DBIC 0.07

0.16  Thu Jul  6 13:28:45 UTC 2006
        - Bugfix for create=static and connect_info coderef snippets
	- Be more verbose when connection_info is not set.

0.15  Tue Jun  6 01:33:57 UTC 2006
        - Fixed a serious bug in create=static usage
        - Re-arranged output generation so that the more likely
          failure to generate Schemas via create= will cause the
          helper to abort before generating the Model class itself

0.14  Mon Jun  5 23:34:35 UTC 2006
        - Helpers merged, helper syntax changed
        - Everything updated for Schema::Loader 0.03001 support, including
          what amounts to using Loader in one-shot mode to generate
          a manual Schema with matching Model.
        - fixed stupid typo in docs

0.13  Wed Apr 26 2006
        - noted support via mailing lists

0.12  Tue Apr 25 2006
        - SYNOPSIS improved substantially to help newbies get started

0.11  Sun Mar 26 17:22:31 UTC 2006
        - Removed on_connect_do config setting (it was only out
          in public for 4 days...).
        - Support for on_connect_do and sql_maker options as part
          of connect_info

0.10  Wed Mar 22 07:06:02 UTC 2006
        - Added on_connect_do config setting
        - Added convenience method for ->schema->storage from paulm

0.08  Tue Feb 28 00:04:16 UTC 2006
        - Bumped D::C::Schema::Loader recommendation to 0.02003
          (should have been done last release)
        - Removed the ->require stuff added in 0.07, it doesn't
          do what it is supposed to do.  For now, users can layer
          at the Schema::Loader level rather than at Model.

0.07  Sun Feb 19 21:50:18 UTC 2006
        - bugfix for ::SchemaLoader::Foo password argument, and
          switch to connect_info argument of new Schema::Loader
        - Added ->require for source classes, so that you can
          layer in lib/MyApp/Model/Foo/Bar.pm on top of the
          generated MyApp::Model::Foo::Bar.

0.06  Sat Feb 18 19:05:17 UTC 2006
        - Fix simple pod-related bug introduced in last rev
        - Added optional test that uses the helpers

0.05  Fri Feb 17 20:52:21 UTC 2006
        - Stop showing the template pod in pod tools and cpan,
          per Gavin's email.
        - Bump DBIx::Class pre-req to 0.05006, to prevent likely but
          subtle issues under mod_perl engines.

0.04  Mon Feb 13 04:22:49 UTC 2006
        - First public release
