Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema

0.08  Tue Feb 28 00:04:16 UTC 2006
        - Bumped D::C::Schema::Loader recommendation to 0.02003
          (should have been done last release)
        - Removed the ->require stuff added in 0.07, it doesn't
          do what it is supposed to do.  For now, users can layer
          at the Schema::Loader level rather than at Model.

0.07  Sun Feb 19 21:50:18 UTC 2006
        - bugfix for ::SchemaLoader::Foo password argument, and
          switch to connect_info argument of new Schema::Loader
        - Added ->require for source classes, so that you can
          layer in lib/MyApp/Model/Foo/Bar.pm on top of the
          generated MyApp::Model::Foo::Bar.

0.06  Sat Feb 18 19:05:17 UTC 2006
        - Fix simple pod-related bug introduced in last rev
        - Added optional test that uses the helpers

0.05  Fri Feb 17 20:52:21 UTC 2006
        - Stop showing the template pod in pod tools and cpan,
          per Gavin's email.
        - Bump DBIx::Class pre-req to 0.05006, to prevent likely but
          subtle issues under mod_perl engines.

0.04  Mon Feb 13 04:22:49 UTC 2006
        - First public release
